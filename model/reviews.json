There was a terrible mess, that had to be cleaned regularly, which was a difficulty for me as I am in my late seventies. I decided to use the Community Tree application, I registered and added my request. Within 24 hours, I received a reply from young people living in the area,. It was a holiday season and they had a lot of free time. They appeared every day for a whole week. That was amazing!"
